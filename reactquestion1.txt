1. What is React?

	React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
        It's often used for creating web applications with dynamic and interactive user interfaces
   	React allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of these components efficiently.


2. What are the advantages of using React?

       It is composable.
       It is declarative.
       It is simple.
       SEO friendly.
       Fast, efficient, and easy to learn.
       It guarantees stable code.
       It is backed by a strong community.
       Increases the application's performance with Virtual DOM.
       JSX makes code easy to read and write.


3. What is JSX?

     JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe the structure of the user interface. 
     It allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript, which is then transpiled into regular JavaScript by tools like Babel. 
     JSX makes it easier to create and visualize the component's structure.


4. What are keys in React?

	Keys are used in React to give a unique identity to elements in a list.
	They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed in a list,
	which is important for efficient rendering and updating of components, especially in lists or loops.


5. What is React Components?
	
        React components are the building blocks of a React application. 
	They are like self-contained, reusable pieces of code that define a part of the user interface.
	class component and function component.


6. What is classComponent and functionalComponent difference?

       classcomponent

         A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function that returns a React element.
         It must have the render() method returning JSX (which is syntactically similar to HTML)
         Also known as Stateful components because they implement logic and state.

     functionalcomponent 

        A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX).
        There is no render method used in functional components.
       Also known as Stateless components as they simply accept data and display them in some form, they are mainly responsible for rendering UI.


7. What is Constructor?


       In class components, the constructor is a special method used to initialize the component's state and bind event handlers.




8.  What is super keyword? 


         In a class constructor in JavaScript, super is used to call the constructor of the parent class when defining a subclass.
         In React class components, you typically use super(props) to pass props to the parent class's constructor.


9. What is the render function?


         In a React class component, the render function is a required method that returns the JSX structure representing the component's UI.
	 This is the part of the component that gets displayed in the browser. 


10. How to change the state value?

     You can change the state of a React component using the setState method.
     This method is used to update the state with a new value, and when the state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated state.



11.  What is the use of Life Cycle Methods?


     React lifecycle methods are special methods that are automatically called as a component goes through various stages of its lifecycle.
     They can be used for tasks like initialization, fetching data, and cleaning up resources.


12.  List of Life Cycle Methods?

      Mounting Phase
  		* Constructor
		* ComponentDidMount
      Updating Phase
		* Render
		* componentDidUpdate()
		* shouldComponentUpdate()
      Unmounting Phase
		* componentwillUnmount()


13.  What is the use of useEffect?

       useEffect is a React Hook used in functional components to perform side effects in your components. 
       It can be used for data fetching, DOM manipulations, and other side effects. It replaces many lifecycle methods in functional components.


14.  What are props in React?


     Props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from parent to child components in React.
     They are read-only you will get an error if you try to change their values.


15.  What is prop drilling in React? 
      
     
       Prop drilling occurs when you need to pass props through multiple levels of nested components to reach a deeply nested child component.
       It can make the code harder to maintain. Context or state management solutions like Redux are often used to avoid prop drilling.


16.  What are React Hooks?


	React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state, side effects, and
	other features that were previously only possible with class components.
 	Common hooks include useState, useEffect, and useContext.



17.   What is React Hooks list?

                useState
		useEffect
		useContext
		useNavigate
		useReducer 
		useparam
		useSearchparam


18.  What are the different ways to style a React component?


 	* Internal Style
	* External Style
	* Inline Style


19.  How do you handle events in React?
      
        React events are named using camelCase.
        With JSX you pass a function as the event handler,
	* onChange()
	* onClick()
	* onSubmit()

20.  How can you update the State of a component?


     You can update the state of a component by using the setState method.
     This method takes an object that represents the new state or a function that computes the new state based on the previous state.



21.   What is React Router?

        React Router is a library for handling routing and navigation in React applications.
	It allows you to create single-page applications with different views and URLs, providing a smooth and consistent user experience.


22.  How do you use BrowserRouter?


       BrowserRouter is a parent component and can have only one child. Links: Let us now create the links of our components.
     

23.   How to use Routes & Links?


       React Router provides the Route component for defining routes and the Link component for navigating between different views.
       The Link component uses props to describe the location to which the link should navigate.
	
       Example:
		import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
		<Link to="/about">About</Link>
		


24. What is the use of useParams & useSearchParams?


            useParams 
		This hook from React Router allows you to access the parameters from the URL, useful for dynamic routing.

	    useSearchParams
		 It allows you to access and manipulate


25.  What is React context? How to createContext?


        React context is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
	It provides a way to share values like themes, language preferences, or user authentication status with all components in the tree. 
	 
              createContext function from React.
		import React, { createContext } from 'react';		
		const Context = createContext();


26. What is the use of Provider & dispatch method?

          provider

        In the context API, the Provider component is used to wrap the part of the component tree where you want to make the context available.
	It takes a value prop, which provides the data you want to share. 

          dispatch

	The dispatch method is not a standard part of the context API but is commonly used in conjunction with state management libraries like Redux.
	It allows you to dispatch actions to update the context state.
     


27.  What is Read in Context values?

         
        To read the values from a context, you can use the useContext hook in functional components or 
         access the context 
	
		import { useContext } from 'react';
		const{state, dispatch} = useContext(MyContext);



28.  How can we pass props from Child to Parent?

        Create a callback method. This method will get the data from the Child to Parent.
	Pass your data as props in Child. The Child will call the Parent callback using props.
	The callback method in the Parent will act as prop to the Child component.



29.  How can we pass props from Parent to Child?

     Passing props from a parent component to a child component in React is the standard way to share data.
     Props are read-only properties that are sent from the parent components to the child.
